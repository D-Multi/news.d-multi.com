title: Engine Switch
---

Welcome! We have finally decided that with the new features of GameMaker: Studio 2, we have decided to switch engines. Instead of sticking with the old and faithful GameMaker: Studio 1.4, we have decided it is worthwhile to switch over to GameMaker: Studio 2. All of D-Multi's past and future games will be switched over to GMS 2. We currently do not own any licenses for GameMaker: Studio 2, but with the development of Midnight Man we hope to make enough profit to purchase the required licenses. Please support us by purchasing a copy of Midnight Man when it comes out in 2019! Thanks you!
